Title: SeqPlots: The interactive tool for visualizing track signal and sequence
    motif density along genomic features using average plots and heatmaps.
Description: The SeqPlots is universal, web browser based tool for plotting
    average track signal (e.g. reads coverage) and sequence motif density over
    user specified genomic features. The data are visualized on linear plot,
    with error estimates as fields, or as series of heatmaps that can be sorted
    and clustered. The dual-purpose implementation allows running the software
    locally on desktop or deploying it on server. The unique features of our
    software are collaboration and data sharing capabilities, as well as
    ability to store pre-calculated result matrixes, that combine many
    sequencing experiments and in-silico generated tracks with multiple
    different features. These binaries can be further used to generate new
    combination plots on fly, run automated batch operations or share with
    colleagues, who can adjust their plotting parameters without loading actual
    tracks and recalculating numeric values.
